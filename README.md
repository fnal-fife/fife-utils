## fife-utils

This is a collection of scripts related to the [FIFE](https://computing.fnal.gov/fife/) project at Fermilab, including utiltities for performing bulk oprations with our [SAM](https://lss.fnal.gov/archive/2012/conf/fermilab-conf-12-189-cd.pdf) and [MetaCat](https://lss.fnal.gov/archive/2021/conf/fermilab-conf-21-061-scd.pdf) ([github](https://github.com/fermitools/metacat/))data handling systems.

The most heavily used is the fife_launch/fife_wrap script pair, which is used to convert physics analysis executables into distributed grid jobs.
